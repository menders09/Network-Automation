Lab setup for network automation course.
Currently my lab topology is failrly simple. At this very moment, I have configured two IOS based routers in VIRL.  Furthermore, Iâ€™m running an Ubuntu VM for Ansible, Vragant etc., etc.  In order to communicate from an external source towards the routers running in VIRL I configured FLAT connectivity in VIRL. As said quite a simple setup. The plan is to add complexity along the learning path.

Best regards,
Marc
